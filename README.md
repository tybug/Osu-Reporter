# Osu-Reporter
A reddit bot to automate housekeeping tasks on r/osureport.

**A warning:** I am not proud of this code. It was one of the first things I wrote in python. It badly needs a rewrite but it "just works" right now and I haven't had time to rewrite it yet.

## Features
* Flairs posts on submission based on title
* Leaves a comment if the title is misformatted
* Leaves a comment with the user's profile and data about them based on the gamemode and username given in the title
* Checks on intervals and flairs posts as resolved if the user reported was banned

## Contact
If you have any issues, feedback, or comments on the bot you can contact me by replying to one of the bot's comments or PMing it at https://reddit.com/u/OsuReportBot. All messages to it are forwarded to me.
